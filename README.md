Climate Analysis Assignment Summary
During this assignment, I conducted a comprehensive climate analysis of Honolulu, Hawaii, in preparation for an upcoming vacation. Here is a brief overview of the key tasks I completed:

Part 1: Analyzing and Exploring Climate Data
I used Python and SQLAlchemy to connect to an SQLite database, reflecting tables into classes (station and measurement) and establishing a connection with the database through a SQLAlchemy session. This ensured seamless data retrieval and manipulation.

Precipitation Analysis
I found the most recent date in the dataset and obtained the previous 12 months of precipitation data by querying the database. This analysis provided insights into the historical rainfall patterns in Honolulu.

Station Analysis
I determined the number of unique weather stations in the dataset and identified the most active stations, listing them along with their observation counts in descending order. Additionally, I retrieved the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS) for the most active station, offering valuable temperature insights.

By successfully completing this assignment, I demonstrated proficiency in data analysis using Python, SQLAlchemy, and data visualization tools like Pandas and Matplotlib. This analysis showcases my ability to extract meaningful insights from data, an essential skill for data-related roles.
